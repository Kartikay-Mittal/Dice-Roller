# Dice-Roller
Dice Roller ðŸŽ² is a simple web-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays two dice, and every time the page is reloaded, both dice roll randomly (1-6). The player with the higher number wins, while a tie results in a draw. This project showcases random number generation, DOM manipulation, and dynamic updates using JavaScript. ðŸš€
